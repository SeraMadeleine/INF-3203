This folder contains four datasets:
input-letters.txt is a small test dataset created to verify that the mapper and reducer functions work as expected. 
input-large.txt is a Wikipedia graph dataset from 2018. It lists all Wikipedia articles, and their outgoing links.
input-small.txt is the same dataset based on data from 2006 instead, it is older and thus smaller.
input-mini.txt is a small excerpt of the first elements of the small dataset, which can be used for easier debugging.
